	How to implement Catppuccin in your own projects
</p>

&nbsp;

### How to

Catppuccin comes in many formats to cover a wide range of project types and tech stacks. Its palettes have especially been designed for UI elements and code syntax highlighting often found in projects build with web technologies like websites; hence why we have a dedicated repository for storing the various formats and presentation of the palettes: [catppuccin/palette](https://github.com/catppuccin/palette).

&nbsp;

### Web Development

Since Catppuccin is heavily used in web technology based projects, it's main installation method is therefore npm, the Node.js package manager.
Install and add it as production dependency by running `npm` from the command line:

```
npm install --save @catppuccin/palette
```

### Graphical Design

Color swatches are simply a palette showing a variety of shades of the same color. Here, Catppuccin has various "swatches" in different formats to be used in software ranging from Adobe Products to graphical design apps such as Figma and InkScape. You can find them under [catppuccin/palette](https://github.com/catppuccin/palette).
